AWS SAML UI Tweak

The SAML authentication user interface at https://signin.aws.amazon.com/saml

This extension makes it a little easier to navigate.

 - Filter the accounts by partial string or account number with the keyboard
 - Use arrow keys to select an account (when multiple results match your filter)


Installation

 - Visit [chrome://extensions](chrome://extensions)
 - Check the 'Developer mode' box at the top
 - Click 'Load unpacked extension...'
 - Find the folder where the repo is checked out
 - Use your keyboard to login to AWS!
